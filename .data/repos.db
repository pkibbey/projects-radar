It's a niche project with potential for growth, but currently lacks significant community engagement and advanced features. The project is actively maintained.\n\n## Key Insights\n\n- **Limited Community Engagement**: The project has very low community engagement (1 star, 0 forks/watchers). This suggests limited visibility and potential for organic growth. Consider promoting the project to relevant communities (e.g., Reddit's r/DJs, music production forums).\n- **Outdated Technology Stack**: Using ES5 and older tools like Bower might limit the project's maintainability and scalability. Consider migrating to modern JavaScript (ES6+) and more current tooling for improved developer experience and access to newer libraries.\n- **Potential for Expansion**: The project has clear potential for expansion with features like support for other DAWs and cloud storage. This could significantly increase its value proposition.\n- **Maintenance Stability**: The latest push date (2025-10-13) indicates active maintenance.  Ensure consistent testing and documentation updates to maintain stability.\n\n## Suggested Actions\n\n- **Promote Project Visibility**: Share the repository on relevant online communities (Reddit, Discord servers focused on music production/DJing) and social media platforms to increase visibility.\n- **Modernize Technology Stack**: Evaluate migrating to ES6+ and updating tooling (e.g., using Yarn instead of Bower) for improved maintainability and developer experience.\n- **Prioritize Feature Development**: Based on user feedback (if available), prioritize adding support for other DAW formats and exploring cloud storage integration.\n- **Improve Documentation**: Ensure the README.md and PROJECT_ANALYSIS.md are comprehensive, up-to-date, and clearly explain how to use the exporter.\n\n\n```json\n{\n  \"summary\": \"The Ableton-Tracklist-Exporter is a functional, albeit simple, tool for extracting tracklists from Ableton Live set files.

However, the lack of stars, forks, and watchers suggests limited community engagement or discoverability.

Addressing ARIA roles, keyboard navigation, and color contrast will enhance the user experience for a wider audience.

Consider optimizing map rendering.\n- **Implement Accessibility Improvements**: Conduct an accessibility audit and address issues related to ARIA roles, keyboard navigation, and color contrast.
