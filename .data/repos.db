Each repository card surfaces:\n\n- live metadata (stars, forks, open issues, recent activity)\n- AI summaries and observations derived from root documentation files (README, PROJECT_ANALYSIS, TODO)\n- actionable checklists you can copy into your workflow\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- Node.js 18.18 or later\n- npm 9 or later (ships with Node)\n- A GitHub personal access token (optional but recommended)\n- Either a local LM Studio instance (default) or an OpenAI API key for hosted inference\n\n## Quick start\n\n1. Install dependencies:\n\n\t```bash\n\tnpm install\n\t```\n\n2. Copy the environment template and update values:\n\n\t```bash\n\tcp .env.local.example .env.local\n\t```\n\n\t- `GITHUB_TOKEN` (recommended): enables higher rate limits, access to private repositories, and permission to sync `PROJECT_INTELLIGENCE.md` back to each repo (`repo` scope required). Without it, the dashboard shows fallback guidance instead of generating fresh intelligence.\n\t- `AI_PROVIDER`: choose `lmstudio` (default) to connect to a locally running LM Studio instance, or `openai` to call OpenAI.\n\t- `AI_MODEL` (optional): override the default model for the selected provider.\n\t- `LM_STUDIO_URL` (optional): override the base URL for LM Studio. Defaults to `http://localhost:1234/v1`.\n\t- `OPENAI_API_KEY` (when `AI_PROVIDER=openai`): enables hosted AI summaries and actions.\n\t- `OPENAI_BASE_URL` (optional): override the OpenAI-compatible base URL.\n\n3. Define the repositories you want to monitor by editing `src/config/projects.ts`.\n\n4. Launch the development server:\n\n\t```bash\n\tnpm run dev\n\t```\n\n5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to explore the dashboard.\n\n## Configuration\n\n- Repository list: edit `projectConfig` inside `src/config/projects.ts`. Each entry accepts `owner`, `repo`, optional `branch`, and optional `displayName`.\n- Documentation files: by default the dashboard looks for `README.md`, `PROJECT_ANALYSIS.md`, `TODO.md`, and `PROJECT.md` in the repository root. Update `DEFAULT_FILES` in the same file to customize.\n- Project intelligence caching: the first time a repository is analyzed, the dashboard stores the AI output in `PROJECT_INTELLIGENCE.md`. Subsequent requests reuse that file instead of calling the model. Remove the file in GitHub if you need to regenerate it manually.\n- AI settings: set `AI_PROVIDER` to `lmstudio` or `openai`. For LM Studio, ensure the desktop app exposes an OpenAI-compatible server (default `http://localhost:1234/v1`). For OpenAI, supply `OPENAI_API_KEY` (and optionally `OPENAI_BASE_URL`).\n\n## Available scripts\n\n```bash\nnpm run dev     # start the Next.js dev server\nnpm run build   # build production assets\nnpm run start   # start the production server\nnpm run lint    # run ESLint\n```\n\n## Deployment notes\n\nThe app is a standard Next.js App Router project. Deploy to Vercel or any Node-capable platform. Remember to configure the environment variables in your hosting provider so GitHub and OpenAI integrations continue to function.\n","url":"https://github.com/pkibbey/projects-dashboard/blob/main/README.md","sha":"b8e7ece6a6eb3aed62e94037d28e1956a2fcfae4"}]},"analysis":{"summary":"Data fetched from GitHub.

It offers features like AI-powered headline transformation, BBC content extraction, and a comparison UI. While promising for educational purposes, it requires significant improvements in reliability, scalability, and ethical considerations before potential commercial viability.\n\n## Key Insights\n\n- **Project Health: Early Stage**: The project is active but appears to be in an early stage of development.  Lack of stars, forks, and watchers suggests limited community interest or visibility.\n- **Potential Risks: Reliability & Scalability**: The reliance on rule-based transformations and potentially fragile HTML parsing introduces reliability risks.  Lack of caching, rate limiting, and robust error handling could lead to performance issues under load.\n- **Ethical & Legal Concerns**: The project's scraping and proxying activities raise ethical and legal concerns regarding BBC's terms of service.  This needs immediate attention.\n- **Missing Testing & CI**: The absence of tests and CI checks increases the risk of regressions and makes future development more challenging.  Automated testing is crucial for maintaining stability.\n- **ML Integration Potential**: The inclusion of `@huggingface/transformers` indicates a clear path for leveraging ML models to improve the headline transformation quality, but this is not yet implemented.\n\n## Suggested Actions\n\n- **Prioritize Reliability & Scalability**: Implement robust HTML parsing (e.g., Cheerio or fast-html-parser), caching, and rate limiting to improve the application's reliability and scalability.  Add monitoring for error rates.\n- **Address Legal & Ethical Concerns**: Thoroughly review and adhere to BBC's terms of service regarding scraping. Consider implementing authentication and logging for responsible data access.\n- **Implement Automated Testing**: Establish a comprehensive suite of unit, integration, and end-to-end tests to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.

So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.\n\nWant some support on the challenge? [Join our Slack community](https://www.frontendmentor.io/slack) and ask questions in the **#help** channel.\n\n## Where to find everything\n\nYour task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design. \n\nThe designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. \n\nIf you would like the design files (we provide Sketch & Figma versions) to inspect the design in more detail, you can [subscribe as a PRO member](https://www.frontendmentor.io/pro).\n\nYou will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.\n\nThere is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.\n\n## Building your project\n\nFeel free to use any workflow that you feel comfortable with. Below is a suggested process, but do not feel like you need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize your project as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/). Creating a repo will make it easier to share your code with the community if you need help. If you're not sure how to do this, [have a read-through of this Try Git resource](https://try.github.io/).\n2. Configure your repository to publish your code to a web address. This will also be useful if you need some help during a challenge as you can share the URL for your project with your repo URL. There are a number of ways to do this, and we provide some recommendations below.\n3. Look through the designs to start planning out how you'll tackle the project. This step is crucial to help you think ahead for CSS classes to create reusable styles.\n4. Before adding any styles, structure your content with HTML. Writing your HTML first can help focus your attention on creating well-structured content.\n5. Write out the base styles for your project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.\n6. Start adding styles to the top of the page and work down. Only move on to the next section once you're happy you've completed the area you're working on.\n\n## Deploying your project\n\nAs mentioned above, there are many ways to host your project for free. Our recommend hosts are:\n\n- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)\n- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)\n- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)\n\nYou can host your site using one of these solutions or any of our other trusted providers. [Read more about our recommended and trusted hosts](https://medium.com/frontend-mentor/frontend-mentor-trusted-hosting-providers-bf000dfebe).\n\n## Create a custom `README.md`\n\nWe strongly recommend overwriting this `README.md` with a custom one. We've provided a template inside the [`README-template.md`](./README-template.md) file in this starter code.\n\nThe template provides a guide for what to add. A custom `README` will help you explain your project and reflect on your learnings. Please feel free to edit our template as much as you like.\n\nOnce you've added your information to the template, delete this file and rename the `README-template.md` file to `README.md`. That will make it show up as your repository's README file.\n\n## Submitting your solution\n\nSubmit your solution on the platform for the rest of the community to see. Follow our [\"Complete guide to submitting solutions\"](https://medium.com/frontend-mentor/a-complete-guide-to-submitting-solutions-on-frontend-mentor-ac6384162248) for tips on how to do this.\n\nRemember, if you're looking for feedback on your solution, be sure to ask questions when submitting it. The more specific and detailed you are with your questions, the higher the chance you'll get valuable feedback from the community.\n\n## Sharing your solution\n\nThere are multiple places you can share your solution:\n\n1. Share your solution page in the **#finished-projects** channel of the [Slack community](https://www.frontendmentor.io/slack). \n2. Tweet [@frontendmentor](https://twitter.com/frontendmentor) and mention **@frontendmentor**, including the repo and live URLs in the tweet. We'd love to take a look at what you've built and help share it around.\n3. Share your solution on other social channels like LinkedIn.\n4. Blog about your experience building your project.

Hundreds of thousands of Digital Camera Raw images, captured over a span of 20 years, all gone. Because I caught this quickly, I was able to extract the images from the hard drive using some disk scanning software. As as result, I got the pictures back, but all the organization was gone - just a big folder with a lot of images in them.\n\nI thought about following the lead on that. What if we just had a big collection of images without any organization? To be able to freely query the images.\n\nSo I started out from scratch, trying to build what seem like the essential features to a photo management system. RAW processing might be useful, but is that something the UI needs to be concerned with. At the very least, the UI needs to be allow the user to navigate through the images in a way that is natural to them.\n\nAt first, I tried to see what my local machine could handle in terms of image processing. Then I made a simple grid of folders and images, and the rest of the UI was built around that.\n\nA key point that I want to adhere to, is the accessibility of the UI. It should be easy to navigate through the images, and the UI should be easy to use, and be able to be controlled with a keyboard.\n\nAt one point, I had to make an architctural decision about whether to always preserve the photos in their original location, or to allow the user to move the physical files. If we keep the files in place, then we don't risk any further data loss. If we allow the user to move the files, it could maintain some syncronization between what the user sees in the UI, and what they see on the folder on their hard drive.\n\nThere are already photo libraries that have tagging, and favourites, and so on. It feels like so much _work_ that the user has to do. Why can't the system just learn what it needs to by the user naturally interacting with their images? \n","url":"https://github.com/pkibbey/image-pal/blob/main/README.md","sha":"313f6609c85dfa484f54cf08351d297ebfc84c39"},{"path":"PROJECT_ANALYSIS.md","content":"## Summary\n\nImage-pal (PAL) is a local-first photo management and browsing app built to help users organize and inspect large, unstructured collections of photos recovered or stored in folders.
