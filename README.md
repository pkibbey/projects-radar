# Projects Dashboard 🚀 - Visualize and Manage Your Work

## About

Projects Dashboard is a lightweight, web-based application designed to help you visualize and manage your ongoing projects. Tired of scattered notes, endless spreadsheets, or feeling overwhelmed by the sheer number of tasks? This dashboard provides a clear overview of your projects, their status, and associated tasks, allowing you to prioritize effectively and stay on track. It's built with TypeScript for maintainability and performance, offering a clean and intuitive user experience.

## Key Features ✨

*   **Project Overview:** Get a quick snapshot of all your projects, including their names, descriptions, and current status.
*   **Task Management:** Add, edit, and mark tasks as complete within each project.  Prioritize tasks with due dates and assigned individuals (optional).
*   **Status Tracking:** Easily update project status (e.g., "To Do," "In Progress," "Completed," "On Hold") with a single click.
*   **Customizable Views:** Filter and sort projects based on status, due date, or other criteria to focus on what matters most.
*   **Local Storage Persistence:**  Your projects and tasks are saved locally, so your data is available even after you close the browser.

## Getting Started 🛠️

**Prerequisites:**

*   Node.js (version 16 or higher) - Download from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
*   npm (Node Package Manager) - Comes bundled with Node.js

**Installation:**

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/pkibbey/projects-dashboard.git

    ```

2.  Install dependencies:

## Usage 💻

The dashboard is designed for ease of use. Here's a quick rundown:

1.  **Adding a Project:** Click the "Add Project" button. Enter the project name, description, and initial status.

2.  **Managing Tasks:** Within each project, you'll see a list of tasks. Click "Add Task" to add new tasks.  You can edit existing tasks by clicking on them and updating the details (description, due date, assignee). Mark a task as complete by clicking the checkbox next to it.

3.  **Filtering Projects:** Use the filter options at the top of the dashboard to narrow down your view. For example, you can show only projects with a status of "To Do."

**Example (Adding a new project via the UI):**

1.  Click "Add Project".
2.  Enter "Website Redesign" in the project name field.
3.  Enter "Complete a full redesign of our company website" in the description field.
